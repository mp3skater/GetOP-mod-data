<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<div class="my-4">
    <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-comment-dots"></i>&ensp;Why did you make this mod?</h3>
    <p>We created this mod, to begin with, as a way to implement some cool textured weapons
        that then caused some crazy chain reaction that made us wanna implement more and
        more stuff as we went along. This project is my first ever coding project and the
        longest I have ever persued (1+ years).</p>

    <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-comment-dots"></i>&ensp;Why should I use this mod?</h3>
    <p>This mod is for anyone that wants a real challenge in his singleplayer-survival or
        SMP world, as it includes structures with really good loot and a FINAL dimension
        of sorts to mark the start and potential (still voluntary) finaly to your world:
        The person that gets the Herobrine swort first is the King of that world.

    are done, open up a pull request and We'll get to work on it.</p>
