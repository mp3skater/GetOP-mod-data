<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<div class="my-4">
    <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-comment-dots"></i>&ensp;Why did you make this mod?</h3>
    <p>When I started developing EarlyGame, there hasn't been any mod that enables early game realism in
    the Fabric mod database. Not even <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-tree-punching" target="_blank"><b><u>No Tree Punching</u></b></a> and <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/natural-progressions" target="_blank"><b><u>Natural Progression</u></b></a>--two Forge mods that I
    really like, has been ported successfully to Fabric. Leveraging my skills in Java from my college
    degree, I thought, "Fine. I'll do it myself." This also serves as my learning experience, as I am no
    professional programmer by any means. You gotta learn something new everyday.</p>

    <p>This mod may bear some similarities with the two aforementioned mods, but I always try to put a
    different taste. As always, your contributions will help the development of this mod, so thanks
    in advance!</p>

    <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-comment-dots"></i>&ensp;Is there any particular roadmap? Where is this leading to?</h3>
    <p>I've always seen it as some sort of a personal/hobby project, but it's also one that I would like
    everyone to enjoy. That being said, I don't really have a particular roadmap as to where this is
    going, but I do have a vision for this and many other projects that may or may not come. Because
    of the open source nature of the mod, EarlyGame is a project with effort from the community who
    loves Minecraft and realism mods, and collaboration is one way to produce progress.</p>

    <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-comment-dots"></i>&ensp;Is it coming for *insert Minecraft version here*?</h3>
    <p>I'll try my best to port it to later versions, but if you are willing to do so, feel free! If you
    are done, open up a pull request and I'll get to work on it.</p>

    <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-comment-dots"></i>&ensp;May I use this in my modpack?</h3>
    <p>Sure thing! Give credit where it's due.</p>

    <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-comment-dots"></i>&ensp;Forge version?</h3>
    <p>Unnecessary. Use either of the two mods I mentioned above.</p>
