    <h3>Get Painite</h3>
    <p>To repair the <b>GetOP Weapons</b> or to craft the <b>Painite Armor</b>
    set you first need to find <b>Painite</b>. It's an ore that is found in the
    <b>The End</b> dimension, mostly at the bottom of the <b>End Islands</b> as
    shown in the video below. To break the block you need at least an <b>Diamond Pickaxe</b>.</p>
